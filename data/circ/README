The circuits in the directory sel_int_div were produced using the pipeline from
https://git.compbiol.bio.tu-darmstadt.de/stammler/int-div-circuits

Each circuit {bitlen}_{prec}.aby calculates the rounding fixed-point integer division

    x, y -> (x<<prec) + (y>>1) / y

where it is assumed that x and y have max bitlength bitlen and the resulting
fp precision is prec. It is also assumed that 0 < x/y <= 1 as this circuit is
used for calculating dice coefficients.
